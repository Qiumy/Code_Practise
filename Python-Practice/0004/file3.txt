The American Academy of Pediatrics has softened its guidelines when it comes to screenwatchin' for the under-twos, stating that they can watch "high-quality programming" (Sesame Workshop, for example) so long as you're there to help understanding and monitor use. If your wee ones are younger than that, you should limit them to video chat for now. The AAP reiterates that, regardless of your children's age, it's important to both set "consistent limits" and ensure that device time doesn't affect physical activity, play and sleep.
